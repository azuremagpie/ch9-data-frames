# Exercise 2: working with data frames
# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100")
# Hint: use the `paste()` function and vector recycling to add a number to the word
# "Employee"
num <- 1:100
employee <- paste("employee", num)
# Create a vector of 100 random salaries for the year 2017
# Use the `runif()` function to pick random numbers between 40000 and 50000
salary_2017 <- runif(100, 40000, 50000)
# Create a vector of 100 salaries in 2018 that have changed from 2017
# Use `runif()` to add a random number between -5000 and 10000 to each of 2017's
# salaries (the negative number means that a salary may have decreased!)
salary_2018 <- salary_2017 + runif(100, -5000, 10000)
# Create a data frame 'salaries' by combining the 3 vectors you just made
# Remember to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`!
salary <- data.frame(employee, salary_2017, salary_2018, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Create a column 'change' that stores each person's change in salary between
# 2017 and 2018
salary$change <- salary_2018 - salary_2017
# Create a column 'got_raise' that is TRUE if the person got a raise (their
# salary went up)
salary$got_raise <- change > 0
### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)
# What was the 2018 salary of employee 57
x <- employee[]
# How many employees got a raise?
# What was the dollar value of the highest raise?
# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?
# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?
# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?
# What was the average salary change?
# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose on average?
## Consider: do the above averages match what you expected them to be based on
## how you generated the salaries?
# Write a .csv file of your salary data to your working directory
